      The <Term type="package">stonesignal</Term> package is extensively instrumented with
      <LinkExternal target="https://opentelemetry.io">OpenTelemetry</LinkExternal>
      in order to allow for the server to be continually monitored. The package publishes
      <Link target="c2dc398a-bfb8-41a4-b9a5-3902f937b60c">metrics</Link>,
      logs, and traces, all of which can be independently enabled or disabled. Most installations will only want to
      enable metrics or logs in production; traces are more useful when trying to diagnose performance
      problems, or for doing actual development on the <Term type="package">stonesignal</Term> package.
