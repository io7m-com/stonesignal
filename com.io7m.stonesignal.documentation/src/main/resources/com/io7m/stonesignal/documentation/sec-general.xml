  <Subsection title="Potential Attack: API Resource Exhaustion">
    <Subsection title="Description">
      <Paragraph>
        An attacker with access to the APIs could send specially crafted messages designed to exhaust
        server resources during parsing/validation of the messages.

      <Paragraph>
        All APIs exposed by the <Term type="package">stonesignal</Term> server are defined in terms
        of simple, flat record types. The 
        <LinkExternal target="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson">jackson</LinkExternal> parser
        is used to deserialize JSON and CBOR requests, and the 
        <LinkExternal target="https://github.com/io7m-com/dixmont">dixmont</LinkExternal> package
        is used to prevent the deserialization of anything other than a fixed list of types.

        Additionally, requests made to the
        <Link target="8527fc4f-5c16-4cf9-bda5-f24ffce783f5">device API</Link>
        and the
        <Link target="b26bc7fc-ebaa-410f-aa9e-0c074f76c329">data API</Link>
        have a hardcoded maximum size limit of
        <Term type="constant">32768</Term> octets.
